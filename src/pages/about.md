I am Alexei Schwab, a map-maker and geographic data specialist based in Cardiff, Wales. I've made maps since 2019, working with humanitarian and human rights organisations to visualise reporting, communicate geographic trends and understand spatial patterns in data. Ealier in my career, I worked on housing and regeneration policy in London. 

# What I do 
I make maps for print or web using whatever tool is most appropriate, from industry standard software like QGIS or ArcGIS Pro to coding languages like Python and R. 

For online mapping, I can work with most major platforms and software: ArcGIS Online, Mapbox/MapLibre, Leaflet, OpenLayers and Felt. 

As well as visualisation, I work on data manipulation and analysis: cleaning messy data, customising third-party datasets, creating new datasets and automating data processes.
